# Directory to my Github
## About
This is a respository to serve as an easy directory to my Github. Each repository will have more README(s) to give information about that repository. 
## Projects
### Dev Apps
I am working on many app projects, but these are the main ones that I am putting public on Github. 

- [Bitcoin](https://github.com/justinwlin/Bitcoin)
  - Bitcoin tracker for phone and android wear. Practice to work with API calls, a bit of UI, and to learn have fun b/c I got into Blockchain technology.

### [Neural Network](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network)
This is a repository with my neural network projects. Using a variety of resources I have been teaching myself about deep neural networks.
  - [Genetic Algorithm to solve a Maze](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/tree/master/MazeGeneration)
    - Teaching myself about genetic algorithms and attempted to apply it to solve a randomly generated maze
  - [Basic Perceptron](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/tree/master/CC_Perceptron)
    - Basic Perceptron to learn the building block of a neural network
  - [Linear Regression/Gradient Descent](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/tree/master/linearRegression)
    - Linear Regression to figure out if "dots" were above a line or not. Trying to learn about gradient descent.
  - [Self-Built Neural Network Using Python and Numpy for Matrix Calculation](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural_Network_Numpy)
    - Applied everything I learnt and wrote from scratch, by myself, a supervised neural network model, using Python and Numpy
  - [NeuroEvolution Flappy Bird](https://github.com/justinwlin/Neural-Network/tree/master/FlappyBird_Neural_Network)
    - **This is code following a series by [Daniel Shiffman]**(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6y21FkaUqw) teaching how to apply and combine genetic algorithm and neural networks together.
    - This was a learning experience project as I followed along, and got to learn how to apply neural networks and genetic algorithms together. By going to the repo, I included ideas on how to further improve the project in the future and how I would go further than the tutorial did. 
### [Side Projects](https://github.com/justinwlin/Side_Projects)
This is a repository of side projects that I undertake to try to get better in programming.
  - [Orderbook Simulator Prototype](https://github.com/justinwlin/Side_Projects/tree/master/OrderBook%20Prototype)
    - Goal of this Order book Prototype was to apply data structure and as a fun side-project to mimic an order book in a simulated market.
    - Reads in a CSV file and executes based on it. 
### [OpenGL](https://github.com/justinwlin/OpenGL)
This is a repository as I try to learn about graphics processing using C++.

### [Aurora - WIP](https://github.com/SteveUcho/Aurora)
A work in progress with a friend to use electron.js, javascript, html, and css to build a graphical interface for Machine Learning.

### MSC
#### [High School Java Game](https://github.com/justinwlin/HS_Final_Java_Game):
Built a game from scratch in Java. 
  - Figured out the math for pixel generation and tile generation.
  - Wrote a level editor program to take in a picture and generate a level based on the pixels.
#### [LFAV - Text Game Simulator](https://github.com/justinwlin/LFAV)
Built a text-battle simulator for a friend. 
  - Prototype to help figure out some details and balancing issue before writing a full on game.
